🚦 Traffic Flow and Accident Analysis
This mini project focuses on analyzing traffic flow and accident data using Python for data cleaning and analysis, and Power BI for dashboard visualization.

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes road traffic accident (RTA) data using Python and Power BI. The goal is to identify patterns, trends, and insights from traffic accidents to support better road safety measures and policy decisions.

📂 Dataset
Source: RTA Dataset (CSV format)

Type: Structured tabular data of traffic accident records

🔑 Key Columns (from RTA Dataset)
Time – Time at which the accident occurred

Day_of_week – Day of the week (e.g., Monday, Sunday)

Age_band_of_driver – Age group of the driver involved

Sex_of_driver – Gender of the driver

Type_of_vehicle – Type of vehicle involved in the accident

Area_accident_occured – Location or region where the accident happened

Road_surface_type – Type of road surface (e.g., Asphalt)

Light_conditions – Lighting conditions at the time (e.g., Daylight, Dark)

Weather_conditions – Weather during the accident (e.g., Rain, Clear)

Type_of_collision – Nature of the collision (e.g., Rear-end, Head-on)

Number_of_vehicles_involved – Count of vehicles involved in the incident

Number_of_casualties – Total casualties from the accident

Cause_of_accident – Reported reason for the accident

Accident_severity – Severity level (e.g., Slight, Serious)

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (Jupyter Notebook – .ipynb)

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

Used for data cleaning, preprocessing, and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Power BI (.pbix)

Used for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations

IDE: Visual Studio Code / Jupyter Notebook
